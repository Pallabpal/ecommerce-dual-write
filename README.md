# # ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Order Service (Outbox Pattern + Kafka + Idempotency + DLQ)

This project demonstrates an **Event-Driven E-Commerce Order Service** using:

- âœ… **Spring Boot** (REST API + Service Layer)
- âœ… **Kafka** for asynchronous event publishing
- âœ… **Outbox Pattern** for atomicity between DB and Kafka
- âœ… **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** for failed event recovery
- âœ… **Idempotent Event Handling** to prevent duplicate processing
- âœ… **MySQL** as the relational database

---

## ðŸ“Œ Architecture Overview

- An order is placed via a REST API.
- The order is saved to the `orders` table.
- An `OutboxEvent` is inserted transactionally in the `outbox` table.
- A scheduled `OutboxPoller` publishes pending events to Kafka.
- Consumers handle Kafka events idempotently.
- Failed events are redirected to a Dead Letter Queue (`order.dlq`).
